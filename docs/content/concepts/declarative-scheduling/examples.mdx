## Defining basic cron schedule on a single asset

The following examples demonstrate how to define a cron on a single asset.

```python file=/concepts/declarative_scheduling/single_asset_cron.py
from dagster._core.definitions.declarative_scheduling.ds_asset import ds_asset as asset
from dagster._core.definitions.declarative_scheduling.scheduling_condition import (
    Scheduling,
)


@asset(scheduling=Scheduling.on_cron("0 0 * * *"))
def my_asset() -> None: ...
```

## Defining some basic cron schedule on multiple assets

The following examples demonstrate how to define a cron on many assets.

```python file=/concepts/declarative_scheduling/many_asset_cron.py
from dagster._core.definitions.declarative_scheduling.ds_asset import ds_asset as asset
from dagster._core.definitions.declarative_scheduling.scheduling_condition import (
    Scheduling,
)

daily_cron = Scheduling.on_cron("0 0 * * *")


@asset(scheduling=daily_cron)
def asset_one() -> None: ...


@asset(scheduling=daily_cron)
def asset_two() -> None: ...
```
